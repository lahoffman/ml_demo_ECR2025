# Machine Learning for Earth Scientists: A Short Tutorial

## Materials

This tutorial includes:
- slide deck: Intro to ML for Earth and Climate Scientists
- code: a tutorial that can be run in Binder [lesson.ipynb]
- data: data required to run the tutorial [data/data_ITP.nc]
- binder link: https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/lahoffman/ml_demo_ECR2025/ce175e268c3edfccbf7965a8908ffaa50f7e260c?urlpath=lab%2Ftree%2Flesson.ipynb

The case study example: 
- Hoffman, L., M. R. Mazloff, S. T. Gille, D. Giglio, C. M. Bitz, P. Heimbach, and K. Matsuyoshi, 2023: Machine Learning for Daily Forecasts of Arctic Sea Ice Motion: An Attribution Assessment of Model Predictive Skill. Artif. Intell. Earth Syst., 2, 230004, https://doi.org/10.1175/AIES-D-23-0004.1.

## Tensorflow Code

Code was written using python 3.8.10 and tensorflow 2.11.0.
